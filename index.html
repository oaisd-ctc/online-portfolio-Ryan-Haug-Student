                        <p> My journey:<br>
                            Ever since I was a kid, the idea of creating through technology has always piqued my
                            curiosity. Whether it was building machines with Minecraft Redstone or experimenting in
                            Scratch, I loved finding logical solutions through play. That passion led me to build my
                            first computer at 13, though I only dabbled in programming until high school. Things really
                            took off in my junior year when I joined the OAISD Careerline Tech Center for software and
                            game development. There, I began with basic HTML and CSS, quickly finishing labs and earning
                            certifications. We progressed to C# console applications in .NET, and finally to Unity for
                            game development; where the combination of physics, logic, and creativity hooked me. I’m
                            returning for my senior year to dive deeper into JavaScript, SQL, and more advanced
                            concepts.</p>

                        <p> My Personal Life: <br>
                            Outside of programming and school, I’m someone who loves staying active and creative in
                            other ways too. I ride a motorcycle because I love the feeling of freedom and the open road.
                            I’m also into photography, I don’t have a professional setup, but I enjoy capturing moments
                            when I can. When I’m not out and about, I like spending time with friends, either at the
                            beach or gaming together. Some of my favorite games are Valorant, Assetto Corsa, Risk of
                            Rain 2, and of course, Minecraft one of the games that helped spark this whole journey in
                            the
                            first place.

                        <h4>3 Day Project | WPF app</h4>
                        <p>
                            This was one of our first big c# projects in the Tech Center. The goal was to collaborate
                            with 2 other people and build a .Net application using tools like github projects and
                            branching, all while ensuring there were no merge conflicts and bugs. We had 3 days to
                            complete the whole project including documentation, and my group decided instead of a .Net
                            application we were going to use Windows Presentation Format (WPF) to create a pacman clone
                            instead. My role in this project was to handle user input and some visual aspects such as
                            the walls. <br>

                        <h4>Final Drive | Unity XR Game</h4>
                        <p>
                            As the final project for our class I wanted to challenge myself to create a cool project, I
                            thought what better way than to make a VR game. So Final Drive was created, the goal of this
                            game is to just make it through traffic as long as possible acheiving a high score. Imagine
                            this as like a endless runner, but with more freedom on choice with how you move.

                        <p>
                            As my first full Project in unity I wanted to create something simple yet replayable. The
                            aim of the game is simple, Just stay alive as long as possible while progressively you and
                            the enemys get stronger. I created this project and all of the art along a ~4 week stretch
                            and I think it turned out great for a first game<br>
